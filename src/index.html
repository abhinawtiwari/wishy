		Wishy helps you collaborate online so as to wish your loved ones on their special days.
		You just have to distribute the link and wishers can upload their wishes in text or video format.
		Rest work is ours. We compile all your wishes and present it nicely in a link.

		You just have to send the link to the special person on his/her special day. That's all.
		This time, try a new way to wish. Let's get wishy!
